# Graph-percolation
Study of how percolation work with different graphs with Arnau Arqué and Pol García

# Assigment
In this assigment we basically had four taks involving the study of the percolation in different types of graphs. For more information of the assigment read the [Assignment paper](https://github.com/pereverges/Graph-percolation/edit/master/README.md)

### Task 1
Given a graph G and q ∈ [0, 1], obrain the resulting graphs of percolation of the nodes and edges.

### Task 2
Study the transition of phase in squared grids of *n x n*, under the percolation proces of nodes and edges.

### Task 3
Study the transition of phase random graphs using different models of the property studied in the Task 2.

### Task 4
Study the transition phase of other graph properties of percolated or random graphs.
